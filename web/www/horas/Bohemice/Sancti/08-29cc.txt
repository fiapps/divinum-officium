sv. Sabiny, Mučednice

[Oratio]
Bože, jenž jsi mezi ostatními zázraky své moci také slabému pohlaví propůjčil vítězství Mučedníků, popřej milostivě, abychom, když slavíme narozeniny pro nebe svaté Sabiny, tvé Mučednice, podle jejího příkladu k tobě spěli.

[Lectio93]
Sabina was a Roman lady, the wife of a distinguished nobleman named Valentine. The Christian faith was taught to her by a maiden named Seraphia. After the martyrdom of this holy virgin, Sabina gathered together her reliques, and buried them with godly service. For this cause she was in a little while arrested, under the Emperor Hadrian, and brought before the Judge Elpidius. Art thou, said he, the same Sabina who is so distinguished for her blood and for her marriage She answered “I am, but I give thanks to my Lord Jesus Christ for having delivered me through the prayers of His hand-maiden Seraphia from the troubling of devils.” Diverse attempts were made to make her change her mind, but when they proved in vain the Praefect passed sentence of death upon her for despising the gods. The Christians laid her body in the same grave in which she had herself laid that of Seraphia, her teacher in the faith.
