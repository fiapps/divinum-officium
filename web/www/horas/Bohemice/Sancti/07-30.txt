[Officium]
sv. Abdona a Sennena, Mučedníků

[Oratio]
Bože, jenž jsi svým svatým Abdonovi a Sennenovi, k této slávě příchodu <i>do nebeské říše</i> udělil dar milosti; dej svým služebníkům odpuštění hříchů; aby pro zásluhy přímluv tvých Svatých si zasloužili osvobození ode všech protivenství.

[Lectio93]
Abdon and Sennen were Persians. In the reign of the Emperor Decius they were accused of interring, on their own farm, the bodies of Christians, which had been thrown out unburied. The Emperor commanded them to be arrested and ordered to sacrifice to the gods. This they refused to do, and persistently preached that Jesus Christ is God, whereupon they were put into strict confinement. When Decius afterwards returned to Rome, he had them led in chains in his triumph. Being thus dragged into the city and up to the idols, they abhorred and spat upon them, for which they were cast to bears and lions; the beasts were afraid to touch them. They were butchered with the sword, and the corpses, with their feet bound together, were dragged before the image of the sun. Thence they were stolen away, and the Deacon Quirinus buried them in his own house.
