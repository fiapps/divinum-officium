[Lectio93]
Euphemia, Lucy, and Geminian were all crowned with Martyrdom in the persecution under Diocletian, upon the same day, though not in the same place. Euphemia was a maiden of Chalcedon, who suffered diverse tortures under the Proconsul Priscus. She endured unflinchingly the rods, the rack, the wheels, and the fire, and in the end was thrown to wild beasts. These all licked her feet, save one, which gave her holy body such a bite, that she forthwith resigned her guileless spirit to God. Lucy was a widow at Rome, who was accused by her own son Eutropius, for that she had for many years worshipped Christ. She was put into a vessel of hot pitch and lead, but came forth unhurt. As she was being haled through the city loaded with iron and lead, the sight of her faith and unwavering testification turned to Christ the nobleman Geminian. He was one of many whom she had brought to the faith, and she had him for a comrade in her glorious martyrdom, for he was diverse ways tormented, and then beheaded. Their bodies were given honourable burial by the Christian lady Maxima.
