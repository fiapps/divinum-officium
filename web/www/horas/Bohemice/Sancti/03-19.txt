Jakub pak * zplodil Josefa, muže Mariina, z níž narodil se Ježíš, nazvaný Kristus.;;109
Poslán byl * Anděl Gabriel od Boha k Panně zasnoubené muži, který se jmenoval Josef, z domu Davidova, a jméno Panny bylo Maria.;;110
Když byla zasnoubena * Matka Ježíšova, Maria, s Josefem, ještě než spolu začali bydlet, shledala, že je čeká dítě z Ducha svatého.;;111
Josef, její muž, * protože byl spravedlivý, a nechtěl ji předvést <i>před lidi</i>, chtěl ji potají propustit.;;112
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord * appeared unto him in a dream, saying: Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary, thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost: and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus.;;116

[Responsory Vespera 1] (rubrica cisterciensis)
Responsorium. Hospodin mě učinil jako králova otce, a Pánem celého jeho donu: nebojte se: * Pro vaši spásu mě totiž Bůh poslal před vámi do Egypta. Alleluja.
V. Přijďte ke mně, a já vám dám všechna dobra Egypta, a pojíte z plodů země.
R. Pro vaši spásu mě totiž Bůh poslal před vámi do Egypta. Alleluja.

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. Let angels chant thy praise, pure spouse of purest bride,
While Christendom's sweet choirs the gladsome strains repeat,
To tell thy wondrous fame, to raise the pealing hymn,
Wherewith we all thy glory greet.
_
When doubts and bitter fears thy heavy heart oppressed,
And filled thy righteous soul with sorrow and dismay,
An angel quickly came, the wondrous secret told,
And drove thy anxious griefs away.
_
Thy arms thy new-born Lord, with tender joy embrace;
Him then to Egypt's land thy watchful care doth bring;
Him in the temple's courts once lost thou dost regain,
And 'mid thy tears dost greet thy King.
_
Not till death's pangs are o'er do others gain their crown,
But, Joseph, unto thee the blessed lot was given
While life did yet endure, thy God to see and know,
As do the saints above in heaven.
_
Grant us, great Trinity, for Joseph's holy sake,
In highest bliss and love, above the stars to reign,
That we in joy with him may praise our loving God,
And sing our glad eternal strain.
Amen.

[Hymnus Vespera] (rubrica cisterciensis)
v. Tento den celá země přeslavného 
Ženicha Panny oslavujme všichni. 
Zástup nebeský jako jeden Svatý 
Zpívá mu chválu. 
_
Stvořitel světa milý náš Spasitel, 
Manžela Matce určil tak čistého: 
Aby se jeho strážcem stal i svědkem 
Panenství Matky. 
_
Když naplnil se spásy čas příhodný, 
Za muže Josef dán byl své Marii, 
Z kmene Judova pocházel i z krve 
Vznešené Králů. 
_
Když přiblížil se čas svatého zrodu, 
Tóho, po němž Otcové dávno lkali,
Josef první Původce naší spásy 
Přešťastně spatřil. 
_
Jemuž pastýři bdíce se klaněli, 
Ovil plenkami, v jesle jej položil, 
Zatím však šťastně v zemi pokoj pěly
Zástupy nebe. 
_
Viděl též hvězdu planout na východě, 
Podle níž k jeslím zamířili dáti
Novému králi, dnes narozenému,
Králové dary. 
_
Buď chvála Otci, vždy i jeho Synu, 
Svatému větru Ducha, také mocnost: 
Neboť jeden Bůh, i v moci jediný,
Všechno ovládá. 
Amen.

v. Joseph, the praise and glory of the heavens,
Sure pledge of life, and safety of the wide world,
As in our joy we sing to thee, in kindness
List to our praises.
_
Thou by the world's Creator wert appointed
Spouse of the Virgin: thee he willed to honour
Naming thee father of the Word, and guardian
Of our salvation.
_
Thou thy Redeemer, lying in a stable,
Whom long ago foretold the choir of prophets,
Sawest rejoicing, and thy God adoredst
Humble in childhood.
_
God, King of kings, and Governor of the ages,
He at whose word the powers of hell do tremble,
He whom the adoring heavens ever worship
Called the protector.
_
Grant us, great Trinity, for Joseph's holy sake,
In highest bliss and love, above the stars to reign,
That we in joy with him may praise our loving God,
And sing our glad eternal strain.
Amen.

Lesson from the book of Genesis
!Gen 39:1-5
1 And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Putiphar an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of the army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Ismaelites, by whom he was brought.
2 And the Lord was with him, and he was a prosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in his master's house,
3 Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
4 And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered to him:
5 And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake.

[Responsory1]
R. The Lord was with Joseph, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
* And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison.
V. And whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it because the Lord was with him, and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper.
R. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison.

[Lectio2]
!Gen 41:37-40
37 The counsel pleased Pharao and all his servants.
38 And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit of God?
39 He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?
40 Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey: only in the kingly throne will I be above thee.

[Responsory2]
R. When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to the king for bread. And the king said unto all the Egyptians:
* Go unto Joseph; and what he saith to you, do.
V. The famine was more grievous every day over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians.
R. Go unto Joseph; and what he saith to you, do.

[Lectio3]
!Gen 41:41-44
41 And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt.
42 And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.
43 And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made govenor over the whole land of Egypt.
44 And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao; without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

[Responsory3]
R. The Lord hath made me as a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house fear not
* For God sent me before you into Egypt, to save your lives.
V. Come unto me, and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
R. For God sent me before you into Egypt, to save your lives.
&Gloria
R. For God sent me before you into Egypt, to save your lives.

[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux.
!2nd on Luke i. 26
What and what manner of man the blessed Joseph was, we may gather from that title wherewith, albeit only as a deputy, God deemed him fit to be honoured he was both called, and supposed to be the Father of God. We may gather it from his very name, which, being interpreted, signifieth Increase. Remember likewise that great Patriarch who was sold into Egypt, and know that the Husband of Mary not only received his name, but inherited his purity, and was likened to him in innocence and in grace.

[Responsory4]
R. Joseph went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem
* Because he was of the house and lineage of David.
V. To be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife.
R. Because he was of the house and lineage of David.

[Lectio5]
If then, that Joseph that was sold by his brethren through envy, and was brought down to Egypt, was a type of Christ sold by a disciple, and handed over to the Gentiles, the other Joseph flying from the envy of Herod carried Christ into Egypt. That first Joseph kept loyal to his master, and would not carnally know his master's wife; that second Joseph knew that the Lady, the Mother of his Lord, was a virgin, and he himself remained faithfully virgin toward her. To that first Joseph it was given to know dark things in interpreting of dreams; to the second Joseph it was given in sleep to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.

[Responsory5]
R. Arise, and take the young Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt;
* And be thou there until I bring thee word.
V. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying Out of Egypt have I called My Son.
R. And be thou there until I bring thee word.

[Lectio6]
The first Joseph laid by bread, not for himself, but for all people; the second Joseph received into his keeping that Living Bread Which came down from heaven, not for him only, but for the whole world. We cannot doubt but that that Joseph was good and faithful to whom was espoused the Mother of the Saviour. Yea, I say, he was a faithful and wise servant, whom the Lord appointed to be the comfort of His own Mother, the keeper of His own Body, and the only and trusty helper in the Eternal Counsels.

[Responsory6]
R. When His parents brought the Child Jesus into the temple, to do for Him after the custom of the law,
* Simeon took Him up in his arms, and blessed God.
V. And His father and mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of Him.
R. Simeon took Him up in his arms, and blessed God.
&Gloria
R. Simeon took Him up in his arms, and blessed God.

[Responsory7]
R. The Mother of Jesus said unto Him Son, why hast Thou thus dealt with us?
* Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
V. And He said unto them: How is it that ye sought Me? Wist ye not that I must be about My Father's business?
R. Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

[Responsory8]
R. Jesus went down with them, and came to Nazareth
* And was subject unto them.
V. He increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.
R. And was subject unto them.
&Gloria
R. And was subject unto them.

[Ant Laudes]
Ježíšovi rodiče chodívali * každý rok do Jerusaléma, na slavný den Paschy.
Když se vraceli, * chlapec Ježíš zůstal v Jerusalémě, ale jeho rodiče o tom nevěděli.
Když nemohli najít Ježíše, * vrátili se do Jerusaléma, a hledali jej; a po třech dnech jej nalezli v chrámě, jak seděl uprostřed Učenců, naslouchal, a tázal se jich.
Řekla mu jeho Matka: * Synu, proč jsi nám to učinil? Hle, tvůj otec a já jsme tě v obavách hledali.
Ježíš šel zpátky s nimi, * a přišel do Nazareta, a byl jim podřízen.

[Hymnus Laudes]
v. Worshipped throughout the Church to earth's far ends
With prayer and solemn rite,
Joseph this day triumphantly ascends
Into the realms of light.
_
O blest beyond the lot of mortal men!
O'er whose last dying sigh
Christ and the Virgin-Mother watched serene,
Soothing his agony.
_
Loosed from his fleshly chain, gently he fleets,
As in calm sleep, away;
And diademed with light, enters the seats
Of everlasting day.
_
There throned in power, let us his loving aid
With fervent prayers implore;
So may he gain us pardon in our need,
And peace forevermore.
_
Glory and praise to thee, blest Trinity!
One only God and Lord,
Who to thy faithful ones unfailingly
Their aureoles dost award. 
Amen.

[Hymnus Laudes] (rubrica cisterciensis)
v. Temonty noci z nebe když zmizely, 
Odtáhly stíny nezvednosti mysli: 
Aby vítězství, které dobyl Josef, 
Věčně chválily. 
_
Již zralý věkem, zmítaný životem, 
Z pouta pradávné smrti vysvobozen: 
Vítěz a panic sešlý dlouhým věkem, 
A prací rukou. 
_
Vítěz nad smrtí, přemohl podsvětí, 
Vystoupil hned z života v blaženost: 
Nejvyšší pro své veliké zásluhy 
Dostal odměnu. 
_
Proto jej vládce pokorně vždy prosme, 
Neb s Nevěstou svou milost nám vyprosí, 
Snažně se přimlouvají bychom měli 
Odměnu v nebi. 
_
Buď chvála Otci, vždy i jeho Synu, 
Svatému větru Ducha, také mocnost: 
Neboť jeden Bůh, i v moci jediný,
Všechno ovládá. 
Amen.
