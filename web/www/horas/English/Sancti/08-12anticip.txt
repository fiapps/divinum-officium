[Commemoratio 3]
!Commemoration of Sts. Hippolytus and Cassian
v. For theirs is the Kingdom of heaven * who love not their lives in this world, and have attained unto the reward of the Kingdom, and have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb.
_
V. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just,
R. And glory, all ye right of heart.
_
Grant, we beseech Thee, O Almighty God, that the worshipful Feast of Thy blessed Martyrs Hippolytus and Cassian may avail us to the increase both of godliness toward Thee, and healthfulness to our own souls.
