[Oratio]
O God, who dost every year bring round unto us again the day whereon this thine~
holy temple was hallowed, and bringest us again in soundness of body and mind to~
be present at thine holy worship, graciously hear the supplications of thy~
people, and grant that whosoever shall come into this thine house to ask good at~
thine hand, may be rejoiced in the obtaining of all his request.
