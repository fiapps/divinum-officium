S. Pantaleon Martyr

[Name]
Pantaleon

[Lectio93]
This Pantaleon was of a noble family of Nicomedia, and was a physician by trade. Hermolaus the Priest taught him well the faith of Jesus Christ, and he was baptized. A little while after, he persuaded his father Eustorgius to become a Christian. He afterwards duly preached the Faith of the Lord Christ at Nicomedia, and exhorted all to embrace His doctrine. For this he was tortured under the Emperor Diocletian, first on the rack, and then by putting red-hot metal to his body. He bore all the bitterness of his torments with a quiet and brave heart, and at last received the stroke of the sword, and grasped the crown of martyrdom.
