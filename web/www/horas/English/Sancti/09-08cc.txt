St. Adrian, Martyr

[Name]
Adrian

[Lectio93]
Adrian was a man who was employed by the Emperor Maximian to persecute the Christians of Nicomedia. The firmness with which they owned their faith and endured their torments oftentimes excited his wonder, and at last so powerfully moved him that he himself turned to Christ. For this he was thrown into prison along with three-and-twenty other Christians. There he was visited by Natalia his wife, who also herself already had believed in Christ, and by her urged on to lift up his testimony. When he was brought out of prison he was lashed until his bowels fell out. His shins were then broken, and his hands and feet cut off, whereafter, in company with many others, he brought to an happy end the conflict of martyrdom.
