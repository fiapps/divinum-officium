99:2a Sing joyfully to God, all the earth: * serve ye the Lord with gladness.
99:2b Come in before his presence * with exceeding great joy.
99:3a Know ye that the Lord he is God: * he made us, and not we ourselves.
99:3b We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. ‡ (4a) Go ye into his gates with praise, * into his courts with hymns: and give glory to him.
99:4b Praise ye his name: (5) for the Lord is sweet, † his mercy endureth for ever, * and his truth to generation and generation.
