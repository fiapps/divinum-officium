Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 1:29-34
At that time, John saw Jesus coming to him, and he said, Behold, the Lamb of God,~
Who takes away the sin of the world! This is He of Whom I said, ‘After me there~
comes One Who has been set above me, because He was before me.’ And I did not~
know Him. But that He may be known to Israel, for this reason have I come~
baptizing with water. And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit~
descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon Him. And I did not know Him.~
But He Who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He upon Whom you will see~
the Spirit descending, and abiding upon Him, He it is Who baptizes with the Holy~
Spirit.’ And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.
