[Hymnus Matutinum]
Of Angles once Apostle thou,
Companion of the angels now,
O Gregory, protect our race,
By faith in Christ restored to grace.
_
Earth’s wealth and riches though didst spurn,
And from its dazzling glory turn
To follow, needy, Christ the King,
Like him, too, lacking everything.
_
On outstretched hand though dost bestow
Two coins a silver dish when lo!
Neath shipwrecked sorry garb concealed,
A noble angel stands revealed.
_
Thenceforth Christ sets thee over his fold,
This teaching church to rule, This teaching place to hold;
To Peter’s honours thou art led,
For in his steps thou firm didst tread.
_
O Pontifex, high abovo all praise,
The Church’s light in thousand ways,
O leave us not in dangers sore,
Once taught and guided by thy lore.
_
All praise to God the Father be,
All praise, Eternal Son to Thee,
And equal glory, as is meet,
To God the Holy Paraclete.
Amen.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:13-19
At that time: And Jesus came into the quarters of Caesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples, saying: Whom do men say that the Son of man is? But they said: Some John the Baptist, and other some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets. Jesus saith to them: But whom do you say that I am?  Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answering, said to him: Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven. Then he commanded his disciples, that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ.
