Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 2:13-18
At that time, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise,~
and take the Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I~
tell you. For Herod will seek the Child to destroy Him. So he arose, and took~
the Child and His mother by night, and withdrew into Egypt, and remained there~
until the death of Herod; that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet~
might be fulfilled, Out of Egypt I called My Son. Then Herod, seeing that he had~
been tricked by the Magi, was exceedingly angry; and he sent and slew all the~
boys in Bethlehem and all its neighborhood who were two years old or under,~
according to the time that he had carefully ascertained from the Magi. Then was~
fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremias the prophet. A voice was heard in~
Rama, weeping and loud lamentation; Rachel weeping for her children, and she~
would not be comforted, because they are no more.
