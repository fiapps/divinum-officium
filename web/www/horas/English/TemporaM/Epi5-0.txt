Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to St. Matthew
!Matt 13:24-30
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to the crowds: The kingdom of heaven is~
like a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men were asleep, his~
enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. And when the blade~
sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the weeds appeared as well. And the~
servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good~
seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’ He said to them, ‘An enemy~
has done this.’ And the servants said to him, ‘Will you have us go and gather~
them up?’ ‘No,’ he said, ‘lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat~
along with them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I~
will say to the reapers: Gather up the weeds first, and bind them in bundles to~
burn; but gather the wheat into my barns.’
