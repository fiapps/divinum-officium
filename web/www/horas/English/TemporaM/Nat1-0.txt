Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:33-40
At that time, Joseph and Mary, the mother of Jesus were marvelling at the things~
spoken concerning Him. And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother,~
Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and for the rise of many in Israel,~
and for a sign that shall be contradicted. And your own soul a sword shall~
pierce, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. There was also Anna, a~
prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser. She was of a great age,~
having lived with her husband seven years from her maidenhood, and by herself as a~
widow to eighty-four years. She never left the temple, with fastings and prayers~
worshipping night and day. And coming up at that very hour, she began to give~
praise to the Lord, and spoke of Him to all who were awaiting the redemption of~
Jerusalem. And when they had fulfilled all things as prescribed in the Law of~
the Lord, they returned to Galilee, into their own town of Nazareth. And the~
Child grew and became strong. He was full of wisdom and the grace of God was~
upon Him.
