Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:42-52
When Jesus was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the~
custom of the feast. And after they had fulfilled the days, when there were~
returning, the Boy Jesus remained in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it.~
But thinking that He was in the caravan, they had come a day’s journey before it~
occurred to them to look for Him among their relatives and acquaintances. And~
not finding Him, they returned to Jerusalem in search of Him. And it came to~
pass after three days, that they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst~
of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who were~
listening to Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers. And when they~
saw Him, they were astonished. And His Mother said to Him, Son, why have You~
done so to us? Behold, in sorrow Your father and I have been seeking You. And~
He said to them, How is it that you sought Me? Did you not know that I must be~
about My Father’s business? And they did not understand the word that He spoke~
to them. And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to~
them; and His Mother kept all these things carefully in her heart. And Jesus~
advanced in wisdom and age and grace before God and men.
