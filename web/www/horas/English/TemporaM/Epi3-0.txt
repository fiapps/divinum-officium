Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 8:1-13
At that time, when Jesus had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed~
Him. And behold, a leper came up and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You will,~
You can make me clean. And stretching forth His hand Jesus touched him, saying, I~
will; be made clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus said to~
him, See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer~
the gift that Moses commanded, for a witness to them. Now when He had entered~
Capharnaum, there came to Him a centurion who entreated Him, saying, Lord, my~
servant is lying sick in the house, paralyzed, and is grievously afflicted.~
Jesus said to him, I will come and cure him. But in answer the centurion said,~
Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; but only say the word,~
and my servant will be healed. For I too am a man subject to authority, and have~
soldiers subject to me; and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another,~
‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it. And when~
Jesus heard this, He marveled, and said to those who were following Him, Amen I~
say to you, I have not found such great faith in Israel. And I tell you that~
many will come from the east and from the west and will feast with Abraham and~
Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the children of the kingdom will~
be put forth into the darkness outside; there will be the weeping, and the~
gnashing of teeth. Then Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; as you have~
believed, so be it done to you. And the servant was healed in that hour.
