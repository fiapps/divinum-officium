We can even state in a different way that which is written in the same words, according to the Hebrew text, in Iasiah: "There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and the Nazarene shall rise up out of his root."

Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 2:19-23
v. But when Herod was dead, behold; an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt, saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel. For they are dead that sought the life of the child. Who arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the room of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither: and being warned in sleep retired into the quarters of Galilee. And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was said by prophets: That he shall be called a Nazarene.
