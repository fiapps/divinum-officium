Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 3:1-6
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate~
was procurator of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother~
tetrarch of the district of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of~
Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiphas, the word of God came~
to John, the son of Zachary, in the desert. And he went into all the region~
about the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,~
as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of~
one crying in the desert, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord, make straight His~
paths. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be~
brought low, and the crooked ways shall be made straight, and the rough ways~
smooth; and all mankind shall see the salvation of God.’
