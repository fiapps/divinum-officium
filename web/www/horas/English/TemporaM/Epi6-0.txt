Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to St. Matthew
!Matt 13:31-35
At that time, Jesus spoke this parable to the crowds: The kingdom of heaven is~
like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. This~
indeed is the smallest of all the seeds; but when it grows up it is larger than~
any herb and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and dwell in its~
branches. He told them another parable: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven,~
which a woman took and buried in three measures of flour, until all of it was~
leavened. All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without~
parables he did not speak to them; that what was spoken by the prophet might be~
fulfilled, I will open My mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since~
the foundation of the world.
