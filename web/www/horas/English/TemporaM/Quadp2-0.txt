Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 8:4-15
At that time, when a very great crowd was gathering together and men from every~
town were resorting to Jesus. He said in a parable: The sower went out to sow~
his seed. And as he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside and was trodden under~
foot, and the birds of the air ate it up. And other seed fell upon the rock, and~
as soon as it had sprung up it withered away, because it had no moisture. And~
other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.~
And other seed fell upon good ground, and sprang up and yielded fruit a~
hundredfold. As He said these things He cried out, He who has ears to hear, let~
him hear! But His disciples then began to ask Him what this parable meant, He~
said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but~
to the rest in parables, that ‘Seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not~
understand.’ Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God. And those by~
the wayside are they who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the~
word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. Now those upon~
the rock are they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and~
these have no root, but believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall~
away. And that which fell among the thorns, these are they who have heard, and~
as they go their way are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life,~
and their fruit does not ripen. But that upon good ground, these are they who,~
with a right and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bear fruit~
in patience.
