Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 20:1-16
At that time, Jesus spoke to His disciples this parable: The kingdom of heaven~
is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his~
vineyard. And having agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them~
into his vineyard. And about the third hour, he went out and saw others~
standing in the market place idle; and he said to them, ‘Go you also into the~
vineyard, and I will give you whatever is just.’ So they went. And again he went~
out about the sixth, and about the ninth hour, and did as before. But about the~
eleventh hour he went out and found others standing about and he said to them,~
‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’ They said to him, ‘Because no man has~
hired us.’ He said to them, ‘Go you also into the vineyard.’ But when evening~
had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers, and~
pay them their wages, beginning from the last even to the first.’ Now when they~
of the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius. And when the first in~
their term came, they thought that they would receive more; but they also~
received each his denarius. And on receiving it, they began to murmur against~
the householder, saying, ‘These last have worked a single hour, and you have put~
them on a level with us, who have borne the burden of the day’s heat.’ But~
answering one of them, he said, ‘Friend, I do you no injustice; did you not~
agree with me for a denarius? Take what is yours and go; I choose to give to~
this last even as to you. Have I not a right to do what I choose? Or are you~
envious because I am generous?’ Even so the last shall be first, and the first~
last; for many are called, but few are chosen.
