Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 18:31-43
At that time, Jesus taking to Himself the Twelve said to them, Behold, we are~
going up to Jerusalem, and all things that have been written by the prophets~
concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished. For He will be delivered to the~
Gentiles, and will be mocked and scourged and spit upon; and after they have~
scourged Him, they will put Him to death; and on the third day He will rise~
again. And they understood none of these things and this saying was hidden from~
them, neither did they get to know the things that were being said. Now it came~
to pass as He drew near to Jericho, that a certain blind man was sitting by the~
wayside, begging; but hearing a crowd passing by, he inquired what this might~
be. And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. And he cried out,~
saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me! And they who went in front~
angrily tried to silence him. But he cried out all the louder, Son of David,~
have mercy on me! Then Jesus stopped and commanded that he should be brought to~
Him. And when he drew near, He asked him, saying, What would you have Me do for~
you? And he said, Lord, that I may see. And Jesus said to him, Receive your~
sight, your faith has saved you. And at once he received his sight, and followed~
Him, glorifying God. And all the people upon seeing it gave praise to God.
