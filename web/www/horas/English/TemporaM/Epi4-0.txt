Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to St. Matthew
!Matt 8:23-27
At that time, Jesus got into a boat, and His disciples followed Him. And behold,~
there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves;~
but He was asleep. So they came and woke Him, saying, Lord, save us! we are~
perishing! But He said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then~
He arose and rebuked the wind and the sea, and there came a great calm. And the~
men marvelled, saying, What manner of Man is this, that even the wind and the~
sea obey Him?
