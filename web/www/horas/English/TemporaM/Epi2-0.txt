!2 Cor 1:12-14
12 For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you. Â 
13 For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known. And I hope that you shall know unto the end:
14 As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

[Responsory4]
R. Keep me, as the apple of thy eye
* Protect me under the shadow of thy wings.
V. Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; thou who savest them that trust in thee.
R. Protect me under the shadow of thy wings.

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 2:1-11
At that time, a marriage took place at Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus~
was there. Now Jesus too was invited to the marriage, and also His disciples.~
And the wine having run short, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no~
wine. And Jesus said to her, What would you have me do, woman? My hour has not~
yet come. His mother said to the attendants, Do whatever He tells you. Now six~
stone water-jars were placed there, after the Jewish manner of purification,~
each holding two or three measures. Jesus said to them, Fill the jars with~
water. And they filled them to the brim. And Jesus said to them, Draw out now,~
and take to the chief steward. And they took it to him. Now when the chief~
steward had tasted the water after it had become wine, not knowing whence it was~
- though the attendants who had drawn the water knew, - the chief steward called~
the bridegroom, and said to him, Every man at first sets forth the good wine,~
and when they have drunk freely, then that which is poorer. But you have kept~
the good wine until now. This first of His signs Jesus worked at Cana of Galilee;~
and He manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.
