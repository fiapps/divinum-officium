Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 15:5-11
In that time, Jesus said to his disciples: I am the vine: you the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing. If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up, and cast him into the fire, and he burneth. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you. In hoc clarificátus est Pater meus, ut fructum plúrimum afferátis, et efficiámini mei discípuli. Sicut diléxit me Pater, et ego diléxi vos. Manéte in dilectióne mea. Si præcépta mea servavéritis, manébitis in dilectióne mea, sicut et ego Patris mei præcépta servávi, et máneo in ejus dilectióne. Hæc locútus sum vobis, ut gáudium meum in vobis sit, et gáudium vestrum impleátur.
