Lesson from the second letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
!2 Cor 10:17-18; 11:1-2
v. Brothers: He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he who commendeth himself, is approved, but he, whom God commendeth.

For I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
