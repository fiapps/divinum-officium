92:1b For he hath established the world * which shall not be moved.
92:2 Thy throne is prepared from of old: * thou art from everlasting.
92:3a The floods have lifted up, O Lord: * the floods have lifted up their voice.
92:3b The floods have lifted up their waves, * (4a) with the noise of many waters.
92:4b Wonderful are the surges of the sea: * wonderful is the Lord on high.
92:5 Thy testimonies are become exceedingly credible: * holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.
