[Oratio]
O God, You Who chose blessed Raymond to be a renowned minister of the sacrament~
of Penance, and miraculously brought him through the waves of the sea, grant~
that by his intercession we may produce good results from our penitence and~
reach the haven of eternal salvation.

We offer You sacrifices of praise, O Lord, in memory of Your Saints; trusting~
that by them we may be delivered from both present and future evils.
