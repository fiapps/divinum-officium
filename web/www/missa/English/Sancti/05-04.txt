Monica

[Oratio] (nisi rubrica cisterciensis)
O God, the consoler of those Who mourn and the safety of those who put their trust in You; Who mercifully accepted the holy tears of blessed Monica for the conversion of Augustine, her son; grant us through the intercession of both to bewail our sins and to obtain the grace of Your forgiveness.
