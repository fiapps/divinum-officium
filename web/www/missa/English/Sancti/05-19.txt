[Officium]
St. Peter Celestine, Pope and Confessor

[Name]
Peter Celestine

[Oratio]
O God, Who raised blessed Peter Celestine to the lofty dignity of Supreme Pontiff and taught him to prefer self-abasement instead; mercifully grant that by his example we may look upon all worldly things as naught, and may be worthy to reap in joy the rewards promised to the humble.
