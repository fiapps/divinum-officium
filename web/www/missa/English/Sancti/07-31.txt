[Oratio]
O God, Who, to spread abroad the greater glory of Your name through St. Ignatius,~
strengthened the Church militant with new power; grant that we who are~
struggling on earth may, by his help and after his example, be found worthy to~
be crowned with him in heaven.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the second letter of St. Paul the Apostle to Timothy
!2 Tim. 2:8-10; 3:10-12
Beloved: Remember that Jesus Christ rose from the dead and was descended from David; this is my gospel, in which I suffer even to bonds, as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound. This is why I bear all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory. But you have closely followed my doctrine, my conduct, my purpose, my faith, my long-suffering, my love, my patience, my persecutions, my afflictions; such as befell me at Antioch, Iconium and Lystra - such persecutions as I suffered, and out of them all the Lord delivered me. And all who want to live piously in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

[Secreta]
May the prayers of St. Ignatius be present with our offerings, O Lord God, that~
the most holy sacrament in which you placed the source of all holiness, may also~
make us holy in Your truth.

[Communio]
!Luke 12:49
I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and what will I but that it be kindled?

[Postcommunio]
May the sacrifice of praise, O Lord, offered in thanksgiving in honor of St.~
Ignatius bring us, by his intercession, to the everlasting praise of Your~
majesty.
