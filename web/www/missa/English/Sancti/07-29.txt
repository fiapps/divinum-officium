[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:38-42
At that time, Jesus entered a certain village; and a woman named Martha welcome~
Him to her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who also seated herself at~
the Lordâ€™s feet, and listened to His word. But Martha was busy about much~
serving. And she came up and said, Lord, is it not concern of Yours that my~
sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her therefore to help me. But the Lord~
answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about~
many things; and yet only one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the best part,~
and it will not be taken away from her.
