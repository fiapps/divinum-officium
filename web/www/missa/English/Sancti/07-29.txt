[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:38-42
At that time, Jesus entered a certain village; and a woman named Martha welcome Him to her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who also seated herself at the Lordâ€™s feet, and listened to His word. But Martha was busy about much serving. And she came up and said, Lord, is it not concern of Yours that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her therefore to help me. But the Lord answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; and yet only one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the best part, and it will not be taken away from her.
