[Oratio]
O God, Who for the glory of Your Church, have graciously honored blessed King~
Canute with the palm of martyrdom and glorious miracles, mercifully grant that,~
as he was an imitator of the Lordâ€™s passion, so may we, walking in his footsteps,~
be found worthy to enter into everlasting joys.
