St. Cyril of Jerusalem, Confessor and Doctor of the Church

[Oratio]
Grant us, we beseech You, almighty God, through the intercession of the blessed Bishop Cyril, so to acknowledge You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom You have sent, that we may be found worthy to be forever numbered among the sheep who hear His voice.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 10:23-28.
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, When they persecute you in one town, flee to another. Amen I say to you, you will not have gone through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. No disciple is above his teacher, nor is the servant above his master. It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and for the servant to be like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household! Therefore do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known. What I tell you in darkness, speak it in the light; and what you hear whispered, preach it on the housetops. And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather be afraid of Him Who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

[Secreta]
O Lord, look favorably upon the unblemished offering we present to You and grant that by the merits of Your blessed Bishop and Confessor Cyril, we may earnestly endeavor to receive it with a clean heart.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
O Lord, Jesus Christ, may the sacrament of Your Body and Blood which we have received, make holy our minds and hearts through the prayers of blessed Bishop Cyril, and thus make us worthy to become sharers of the divine nature.
