[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 19:27-29
At that time, Peter said to Jesus, Behold, we have left all and followed You;~
what then shall we have? And Jesus said to them, Amen I say to you that you who~
have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit on the~
throne of His glory, shall also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes~
of Israel. And everyone who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father,~
or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My nameâ€™s sake, shall receive a~
hundredfold, and shall possess life everlasting.

[Secreta]
We offer You sacrifices of praise, O Lord, in memory of Your Saints; trusting~
that by them we may be delivered from both present and future evils.
