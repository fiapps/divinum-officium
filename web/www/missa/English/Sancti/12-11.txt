Lesson from the first letter of St. Peter the Apostle
!1 Pet. 5:1-4, 10-11.
Beloved: I exhort the presbyters among you - I, your fellow presbyter and witness of the sufferings of Christ, the partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed in time to come - tend the flock of God which is among you, governing not under constraint, but willingly, according to God; nor yet for the sake of base gain, but eagerly; nor yet as lording it over your charges, but becoming from the heart a pattern to the flock. And when the Prince of the shepherds appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. But the God of all grace, Who has called us unto His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will Himself, after we have suffered a little while, perfect, strengthen and establish us. To Him is the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

[Offertorium]
!Jer 1:9-10
See, I place My words in your mouth! I set you over nations and over kingdoms,~
to root up and to tear down, and to build and to plant.

[Secreta]
Having offered You our gifts, we beseech You, O Lord, mercifully to enlighten~
Your Church, so that Your flock may everywhere prosper, and its shepherds, under~
Your guidance, be rendered acceptable to You.

Since Your Church has been nourished by sacred food, govern her in Your clemency,~
we beseech You, O Lord, so that under the guidance of Your almighty rule she may~
enjoy ever greater freedom and remain steadfast in purity of faith.
