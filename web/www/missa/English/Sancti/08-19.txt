[Officium]
St. John Eudes, Confessor

[Oratio]
O God, Who wondrously enkindled St. John, Your Confessor, to promote the religious veneration of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and through him willed to found new religious families in the Church; grant, we beseech You, that we may honor his holy merits and may learn from the example of his virtues.
