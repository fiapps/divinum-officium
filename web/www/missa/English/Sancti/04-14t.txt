We beg, O Lord, that the sacrifice we offer in memory of the birthday of thy holy Martyrs may losen the bonds of our sins and win for us the gist of thy mercy.

Having taken our fill of thy sacred gift we humbly entreat thee, O Lord, that for the due service which we pay thee, we may enjoy an increase of thy  saving grace.
