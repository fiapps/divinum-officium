[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 6:24-33
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: No man can serve two masters; for~
either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will stand by the one~
and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say to you,~
do not be anxious for your life, what you shall eat; nor yet for your body, what~
you shall put on. Is not the life a greater thing than the food, and the body~
than the clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow, or reap, or~
gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you of much~
more value than they? But which of you by being anxious about it can add to his~
stature a single cubit? And as for clothing, why are you anxious? Consider how~
the lilies of the field grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I say to you that~
not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these. But if God so~
clothes the grass of the field, which flourishes today but tomorrow is thrown~
into the oven, how much more you, O you of little faith! Therefore do not be~
anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or, ‘What shall we drink?’ or, ‘What are~
we to put on?’ -for after all these things the Gentiles seek- for your Father~
knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His~
justice, and all these things shall be given you besides.

[Postcommunio]
We beseech You, almighty God, that we who have partaken of heavenly nourishment,~
may, by the intercession of St. Cajetan, Your Confessor, be strengthened by it~
against all adverse influences.
