[Oratio]
O God, Who, to enable him to accomplish tasks, no matter how difficult, for the~
glory of Your name and the salvation of souls, endowed blessed Lawrence, Your~
Confessor and Doctor, with the spirit of wisdom and fortitude; grant us, in the~
same spirit, ever to know our duty, and through his prayers to do it.
