[Lectio]
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Galatians
!Gal 1:11-20
Brethren: I give you to understand, that the gospel which was preached by me is not of man. For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it; but I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism; how beyond all measure I persecuted the Church of God, and ravaged it. And I advanced in Judaism above many of my contemporaries in my nation, showing much more zeal for the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased Him Who from my motherâ€™s womb set me apart and called me by His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, immediately, without taking counsel with flesh and blood, and without going up to Jerusalem to those who were appointed Apostles before me, I retired into Arabia, and again returned to Damascus. Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to see Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other Apostles, except James, the brother of the Lord. Now in what I am writing to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.

[Graduale]
!Gal 2:8-9
He Who worked in Peter for the apostleship, worked also in me among the Gentiles; and they recognized the grace of God, that was given to me.
!1 Cor. 15:10
V. The grace of God in me has not been fruitless; but His grace always remains in me. Alleluia, alleluia.
V. Holy Apostle Paul, preacher of truth, and teacher of the Gentiles, intercede for us. Alleluia.
